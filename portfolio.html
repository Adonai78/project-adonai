    <p class="bottem"> As a young teen I always wanted to get my learners permit so I could drive not only myself but my
      friends too. I would always go with my mom to the car wash and even after that her car still looked dirty so I
      decided to wash. Wash is an app where people can log in and they can see all kinds of car detailers around their
      area and the detailers can wash high end cars. The wash app works for home windows too. And addition to that
      people who clean homes can also be on the app.
